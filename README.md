## Open closed Principle (OSP)
open for extension, but closed for modification

## Liskov substitution Principle (LSP)
 child classes must be substitutable for their parent classes

## Dependency Inversion Principle
The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.
